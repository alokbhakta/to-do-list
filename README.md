To-Do List Application
Created a user-friendly To-Do List application to assist with day-to-day task management. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring efficient organization of daily activities. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project highlights my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design. The To-Do List application provides an intuitive interface for users to 
manage their daily work effectively.
